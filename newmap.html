 <pre> <a id="lyrics">
    There's a hole in your heart, begging for adventure.
    Play yourself a new track, set traps for the future.
    On your own.
    Can you do it?
    The unknown.
    Can you face it?
    
    Shifting desire, shifting desire, shifting desire...
    
    Rules of conformity, heavy clouds of reason.
    They're hiding the beauty of your free distortions.
    On your own.
    Can you do it?
    The unknown.
    Can you face it?
    With your soul, now you see it.
    The landscape is infinite.
    
    Shifting desire, shifting desire, shifting desire... </pre>
